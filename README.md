## 🚀 More About Me

I'm an IT technician with a background in systems administration and telecommunications, now focused on building a career in cybersecurity, especially in the offensive security field.

Curious and self-motivated, I'm constantly learning and improving my skills through courses, labs, and CTF challenges. I enjoy exploring how systems work, finding weaknesses, and learning how to protect them. Right now, I'm developing my knowledge in vulnerability assessment, red teaming mids,blue team basics and security tools.

I'm looking for opportunities where I can grow, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to real-world security projects.
